            <h2>Hi! I'm Stacie.</h2>
            <p>
                Oh my goodness. I'm moving all the stuff from my previous site over and am realizing how dated this bio is!
                Things are very different now. I work at Zapier in Support and trying to transition onto the Engineering team
                when my year commitment in support is served. Still just a momma who is hustlin' hard all day, every day. But
                those kiddos are bigger now. Spend a lot of my free time building collab lab stuff with segdeha. Spend my other
                time trying to code things. I'll refine this later, but in the meantime, here is a bio on Stacie when she was
                transferring from PM to dev. :shrug:
                <br><br>
                Born and raised in the Midwest, I’m now happily rooted in Sacramento, California with my husband and two
                children. An ESFJ to the core, I naturally excel at organizing processes, squashing inefficiencies, and
                participating in dance breaks. With a Bachelor in Communication, I can speak in more than just well-documented
                code. I’ve been pursuing my passion for building clear processes at a tech startup, where I’ve focused on app
                development and creating user experiences that improve people’s daily lives. Not one to settle for “good
                enough”, I’ve pursued self-guided learning through Bloc.io’s Full Stack Development program, all while balancing
                two small children and working full-time as a remote Product Manager. I’m always on the lookout for exciting and
                rewarding opportunities with invaluable mentorship.
